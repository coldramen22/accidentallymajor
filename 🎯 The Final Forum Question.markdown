## 🎯 The Final Forum Question

> **Title:** The paralysis of perfectionism is ruining my life and has been for long enough.

> **Body:**
> I am grappling with **existential inertia** and its crippling symptoms (**addiction, underachieving**) which I trace back to an unattainable standard of ethical **perfection**—a particularly vicious cycle when integrating **shadow work** and past wounds. The pursuit of flawless **integrity** results in psychological paralysis, not action.
> I seek to identify the core Scholastic and Virtue Ethics concepts that provide a mechanism for **re-entry** into virtuous living, validating *effort* over *flawless result*.
> 1. **The Priority of the Will:** How do we conceptually shift focus from the *perfect state* of the **virtuous *habitus*** to the simple, often flawed, function of the **will**? Given that my **Intentionality** toward the good is often judged and condemned by the imperfection of the resulting action, what precise role does **Prudence (*Prudentia*)** play in correctly ordering small, messy actions as *genuinely virtuous steps*?
> 2. **Humility as the Necessary Virtue:** How does **Humility** function as the direct counter-virtue to the **Perfectionist's Pride**? If Humility is understood as **self-knowledge** (the honest appraisal of one's limits and wounds, rather than self-deprecation), how does this self-acceptance of imperfection free the **will** to act repeatedly, allowing for the *process* of virtue to unfold?
> 
> 
> What specific theological or ethical concepts validate the **imperfect, messy process** of virtue over the demand for its **perfect, immediate product**?

This question is precise, uses the necessary concepts (**habitus**, **will/intentionality**, **prudence**, **humility**), and directly addresses your personal struggle by asking for the conceptual "path out."
